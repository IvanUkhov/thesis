In this chapter, we have elaborated on deterministic analysis and design of
electronic systems. Due to the paramount importance of power and temperature for
efficiency and robustness, our focus has been primarily on these two quantities.
Three types of temperature analysis have been covered in detail: transient
analysis, static steady-state analysis, and dynamic steady-state analysis. We
have proposed an auxiliary transformation of the temperature model that allows
for computationally efficient and convenient calculations associated with
temperature analysis. Leveraging the transformation, we have developed a fast
and accurate solution to dynamic steady-state analysis. Using our solution, we
have conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization addressing
thermal-cycling fatigue and have shown that taking temperature fluctuations into
consideration can significantly prolong the lifetime of the system under
consideration without affecting its energy efficiency.

As discussed in \sref{motivation}, uncertainty-unaware analysis misrepresents
reality, and uncertainty-unaware design produces unsatisfactory, if not strictly
dangerous, products. Therefore, the designer of electronic systems cannot
directly rely on techniques such as the ones presented in this chapter. These
techniques, however, constitute an important building block for those that take
uncertainty into consideration, which we discuss in the following chapters.
