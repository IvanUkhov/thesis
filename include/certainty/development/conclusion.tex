In this chapter, we have elaborated on deterministic analysis and design of
electronic systems. Due to the paramount importance of power and temperature for
efficiency and robustness, our focus has been primarily on these two quantities.
Three types of temperature analysis have been covered in detail: transient
analysis, static steady-state analysis, and dynamic steady-state analysis. We
have proposed an auxiliary transformation of the temperature model that allows
for computationally efficient and convenient calculations associated with
temperature analysis. Leveraging the transformation, we have developed a fast
and accurate solution to dynamic steady-state analysis. Using our solution, we
have conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization addressing the
thermal-cycling fatigue and have shown that taking into consideration
temperature fluctuations can significantly prolong the lifetime of the system
under consideration without affecting its energy efficiency.
