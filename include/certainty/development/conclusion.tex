In this chapter, we have elaborated on deterministic analysis of computer
systems. Due to the paramount importance of temperature for an efficient and
robust design, our focus has been primarily on temperature analysis and related
disciplines. Three types of temperature analysis have been covered in detail:
transient analysis, static steady-state analysis, and dynamic steady-state
analysis. We have proposed an auxiliary transformation of the temperature model
that allows for computationally efficient and convenient calculations associated
with temperature analysis. Leveraging the transformation, we have developed a
fast and accurate solution to dynamic steady-state analysis. Using this solution
technique, we have conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization
addressing the thermal-cycling failure and have shown that taking into
consideration temperature fluctuations can significantly prolong the lifetime of
the system under consideration without affecting its energy efficiency.
