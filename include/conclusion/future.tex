There are several potential directions for future work. One general remark is
that it would be insightful to investigate how our uncertainty-aware techniques
perform in practice. We have conducted such an investigation in the case of the
interpolation-based technique presented in
\cref{uncertainty-workload-development}; however, this investigation is
relatively small and has been done in an academic setting. Industrial settings
are different, and they might help to reveal blind spots.

The early investigation reported in \cref{uncertainty-workload-operation} is
arguably the most prominent direction for further development in the scope of
this thesis. In situations where workload can vary dramatically and without any
apparent regularity, mitigation of uncertainty at runtime is considered
advantageous, since one has access to large amounts of relevant and previously
inaccessible-by-definition information and hence can make more deliberate
decisions. As emphasized throughout \cref{uncertainty-workload-operation},
modern architectures of neural networks accompanied by modern approaches to
training have great potential, and resource management is the foremost
beneficiary in this regard. This potential, however, is yet to be materialized.
Extensive research in this direction is highly needed.
