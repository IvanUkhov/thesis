I would like to express my enormous gratitude to \person{Else}{Petru} and
\person{Peng}{Zebo} for their caring and discerning supervision of my graduate
studies at Linköping University. I cannot possibly imagine a better research
environment than the one Petru and Zebo have created in our Embedded Systems
Laboratory.

I am extremely grateful to \person{Marculescu}{Diana} for her thorough
supervision during my four-month visit to Carnegie Mellon University. Being part
of a different research group was an invaluable professional experience, and
Diana made sure that this experience was also impeccably smooth and delightful.

I would like to thank \person{Villani}{Mattias} for his insightful pieces of
advice and constant readiness to lend a helping hand of a natural-born Bayesian
to those who are hopelessly lost in statistics.

I am thankful to \person{Moe}{Anne} for attentively guiding graduate students
towards doctoral hats, which must be akin in difficulty to herding cats. I am

easier.
