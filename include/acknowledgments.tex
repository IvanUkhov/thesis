\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\newcommand\person[2]{#2 #1}

I would like to express my enormous gratitude to Professor \person{Else}{Petru}
and Professor \person{Peng}{Zebo} for their exhaustive and discerning
supervision of my graduate studies at Linköping University. I cannot possibly
imagine a better research environment than the one Petru and Zebo have created
and carefully maintained over all the years in our Embedded Systems Laboratory.

I am extremely grateful to Professor \person{Marculescu}{Diana} for her caring
and thorough supervision during my visit to Carnegie Mellon University. Being
part of a different research group in a different country for four whole months
was an invaluable professional experience, and Diana made sure that this
experience was also impeccably smooth and indispensably delightful.

I would like to thank Professor \person{Villani}{Mattias} for his insightful
pieces of advice and constant readiness to lend a helping hand of a natural-born
Bayesian to those who occasionally or always find themselves lost in statistics.

I am thankful to \person{Moe}{Anne} for steadily leading our chaotic flock of
graduate students toward doctoral hats, which must be akin in difficulty to
herding cats. I am also thankful to \person{Johansson}{Marie} for her kind help
in every matter.

Over the course of my doctoral education, I have had the pleasure to meet many
other amazing people who have been instrumental in making it possible for me to
get to the finish line of this challenging and gratifying endeavor.

I thank \person{Rafiliu}{Sergiu} for welcoming me at the train station on my
very first day in Linköping. I thank \person{Bao}{Min} for helping me take my
very first steps as a researcher. I thank \person{Samii}{Soheil} for being an
excellent example of a senior graduate student and then a doctor whom I aspired
to become one day.

I thank \person{SenGupta}{Breeta} for sharing my passion for photography. I am
thankful to \person{Dutta Bordoloi}{Unmesh} and \person{Rezine}{Ahmed} for being
reassuring. I thank \person{Tanasa}{Bogdan} for our fervent discussions about
probability.

I thank \person{Vasilevskaya}{Maria} for not letting me forget my Russian. I
thank \person{Malmberg}{Lisa} and \person{Hansson}{Erik} for patiently answering
my myriad of questions about Swedish.

I am grateful to \person{Horga}{Flavia}, \person{Horga}{Adrian},
\person{Alsaadi}{Sarah}, \person{Lifa}{Adrian}, \person{Arvanitaki}{Antonia},
\person{Holmbäck}{Mikaela}, \person{Maghazeh}{Arian}, and
\person{Toczé}{Klervie} for our merry gatherings.

I am grateful to my parents, Tatiana Ukhova and Aleksandr Ukhov, for their care
and support.
