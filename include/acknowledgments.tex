\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\newcommand\person[2]{#2 #1}

I would like to express my enormous gratitude to Professor \person{Else}{Petru}
and Professor \person{Peng}{Zebo} for their exhaustive and discerning
supervision of my graduate studies at Linköping University. I cannot possibly
imagine a better research environment than the one Petru and Zebo have created
and carefully maintained over all these years in our dear Embedded Systems
Laboratory.

I am extremely grateful to Professor \person{Marculescu}{Diana} for her caring
and thorough supervision during my visit to Carnegie Mellon University. Being
part of a different research group in a different country for four months was an
invaluable professional experience, and Diana made sure that this experience was
also impeccably smooth and indispensably delightful.

I would like to thank Professor \person{Villani}{Mattias} for his insightful
pieces of advice and constant readiness to lend a helping hand of a natural-born
Bayesian to those who occasionally find themselves hopelessly lost in
statistics.

I am thankful to \person{Moe}{Anne} for steadily leading our chaotic flock of
graduate students towards doctoral hats, which must be akin in difficulty to
herding cats. I am also thankful to \person{Johansson}{Marie},
\person{Kärrman}{Åsa}, and \person{Pelayo Danils}{Eva} for making the life of a
graduate student so much easier.

Over the course of my doctoral education, I have had the pleasure to meet many
other amazing people who have been instrumental---should it be directly or
not---in making it possible for me to make it till the end.

I thank \person{Bao}{Min} and \person{Samii}{Soheil} for the very beginning of
this journey. Min helped me take my first research steps while Soheil, who was a
few months away from graduation, was my mentor without probably realizing it.
