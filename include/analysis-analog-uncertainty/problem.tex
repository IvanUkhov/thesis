Consider a generic electronic system, which is fabricated on a silicon wafer
that accommodates \nd dies. Let \spec refer collectively to the specification of
the manufacturing process and of the system itself including the layout of the
wafer and the floorplan of the dies. The system depends on a process parameter
\g, which we are interested in studying and shall refer to as the quantity of
interest. Due to the presence of process variation, the value of \g deviates
from the nominal one, and this deviation can be different at different locations
on the wafer. The quantity is assumed to be impractical to be measured directly.

Given \spec, the goal is to develop a framework targeted at the identification
of the on-wafer distribution of \g with the following properties: \one~low
measurement costs, \two~high computation speed, \three~robustness to the
measurement noise, \four~ability to accommodate prior knowledge on \g, and
\five~ability to assess the trustworthiness of the collected data and
corresponding predictions.
