The construction of high-dimensional rules should be undertaken with a great
care as, without special treatments, the number of points grows exponentially.
In what follows, we address this crucial aspect.

Let $f: \real^\nz \to \real$ and define the quadrature-based approximation of
the integral of $f$ by the linear functional
\[
  \quadrature{\nz}{\lq}{f} := \sum_{i = 1}^\nq f(\v{x}_i) \, w_i
\]
where $\{ (\v{x}_i \in \real^\nz, w_i \in \real) \}_{i = 1}^\nq$ are the points
and weights of the chosen quadrature. \rref{multiple-dimensions} applies in this
context as well. The subscript $\lq \in \natural$ denotes the level of the rule,
which is its index in the corresponding family of rules with increasing
precision. The precision refers to the maximal total order of polynomials that
the quadrature integrates exactly. The number of points $\nq$ can be deduced
from the pair $(\nz, \lq)$, which we shall occasionally emphasize by writing
$\nq(\nz, \lq)$. For the Gauss--Hermite quadrature rules in one dimension, we
have that $\nq = \lq + 1$ and the precision is $2 \nq - 1$ \cite{heiss2008} or,
equivalently, $2 \lq + 1$, which is a remarkable property of Gaussian
quadratures.

The foundation of a multidimensional rule $\quadrature{\nz}{\lq}$ is a set of
one-dimensional counterparts $\{ \quadrature{1}{i} \}_{i = 0}^\lq$. A
straightforward construction is the tensor product of $\nz$ copies of
$\quadrature{1}{\lq}$:
\[
  \quadrature{\nz}{\lq} = \bigotimes_{i = 1}^\nz \quadrature{1}{\lq},
\]
which is referred to as the full-tensor product. In this case, $\nq(\nz,
\lq) = \nq(1, \lq)^\nz$, that is, the growth of the number of points is
exponential. Moreover, it can be shown that most of the points obtained via this
construction are an excess as the full-tensor product does not take into account
the fact that the integrands under consideration are polynomials whose total
order is constrained according to a certain strategy.

An alternative construction is the Smolyak algorithm \cite{maitre2010,
eldred2008}. Intuitively, the algorithm combines $\{ \quadrature{1}{i} \}_{i =
0}^\lq$ such that $\quadrature{\nz}{\lq}$ is tailored to be exact only for a
specific polynomial subspace. Define $\Delta_0 := \quadrature{1}{0}$ and
$\Delta_i := \quadrature{1}{i} - \quadrature{1}{i - 1}$ for $i \geq 1$. Then
Smolyak's approximating formula is
\[
  \quadrature{\nz}{\lq} = \bigoplus_{\multiindex \in \multiindices{\lq}} \Delta_{\alpha_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \Delta_{\alpha_\nz}.
\]
In the original (isotropic) formulation of the Smolyak algorithm,
$\multiindices{\lq}$ is the same as the one defined in
\eref{isotropic-total-order-index-set}; the resulting sparse grid is exact for
polynomials of total order $2 \lq + 1$ (analogous to the integration in one
dimension). Note that, although we use the same notation in
\eref{full-tensor-product-grid} and \eref{smolyak-sparse-grid}, the two
constructions are generally different. (The latter reduces to the former if
$\multiindices{\lq}$ is set to $\{ \multiindex: \max_i \alpha_i
\leq \lq \}$.) It can be seen that the construction in
\eref{smolyak-sparse-grid} is a summation of cherry-picked tensor products of
one-dimensional quadrature rules. Equation \eref{smolyak-sparse-grid} is well
suited for grasping the structure of the resulting sparse grids; more
implementation-oriented versions of the Smolyak formula can be found in the
cited literature.

The integral of a function $g: \real \to \real$
\[
  I = \int_\real g(x) \d x
\]
is approximated by a summation of the function's values computed at prescribed
points $\{ \hat{x}_i \in \real \}_{i = 1}^\nq$ and multiplied by prescribed
weights $\{ w_i \in \real \}_{i = 1}^\nq$, which we denote as follows:
\[
  I \approx \quadrature{1}{\lq}{g} = \sum_{i = 1}^\nq g(\hat{x}_i) w_i.
\]
Such a pair of a set of points and a set of weights is called a quadrature rule.
In the notation $\quadrature{1}{\lq}$, the superscript $1$ indicates that it is
a one-dimensional rule, and the subscript \lq gives the level of the rule, which
is the index of the rule in the corresponding family of quadrature rules with
increasing accuracy. In the one-dimensional case, \lq corresponds to the maximum
order of polynomials that the rule integrates exactly \cite{heiss2008}.
Similarly, in multiple dimensions, the integral of a function $g: \real^n \to
\real$
\[
  I = \int_{\real^n} g(\v{x}) \d \v{x}
\]
is approximated by
\begin{equation} \elab{quadrature-summation}
  I \approx \quadrature{n}{\lq}{g} = \sum_{i = 1}^\nq g(\hat{\v{x}}_i) w_i.
\end{equation}
An appropriate $n$-dimensional quadrature rule $\quadrature{n}{\lq}$ is
typically formed by computing the tensor product of $n$ potentially distinct
one-dimensional quadrature rules. The number of terms \nq in summations is
dictated by both $n$ and \lq. Lastly, it is worth noting that quadrature rules
are generally precomputed and tabulated since they do not depend the integrand;
see, for instance, \cite{burkardt}.

Consider now the following more general integral:
\[
  I = \int_{\real^n} g(\v{x}) \d F(\v{x}).
\]
Here $g$ is integrated with respect to a measure $F: \real^n \to \real$
\cite{durrett2010} that does not necessarily correspond to the usual Lebesgue
measure used in the earlier examples. If $F$ is absolutely continuous, the
integrand can be rewritten as
\[
  I = \int_{\real^n} g(\v{x}) f(\v{x}) \d \v{x}
\]
where $g$ is weighted by the derivative $f: \real^n \to \real$ of $F$ and
integrated with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Since integrating in such a way
is a very frequent operation, there are families of quadrature rules that are
designed to automatically take this aspect into account for the most common
scenarios.

Let us highlight one broad class of quadrature rules known as Gaussian
quadratures. The level \lq of a one-dimensional Gaussian quadrature with \nq
points is $2 \nq - 1$. In other words, the rule integrates exactly polynomials
of an order up to $2 \nq - 1$. This feature makes such rules especially
efficient \cite{heiss2008}.

There is one more and arguably the most crucial aspect of numerical integration
that we ought to discuss: the algorithm used to construct multidimensional
quadrature rules. In low dimensions, the construction can be based on the direct
tensor product of one-dimensional rules. However, in high dimensions, the
situation changes dramatically as the number of points produced by this approach
can easily explode. For instance \cite{heiss2008}, if a one-dimensional rule has
only 4 points, that is, $\nq = 4$, then in 10 stochastic dimensions, that is, $n
= 10$, the number of multivariate points becomes $\nq = 4^{10} = 1~048~576$,
which is not affordable. Moreover, it can be shown that most of the points
obtained in this way do not contribute to the asymptotic accuracy and, hence,
are a waste of time. In order to tackle this problem, one resides to sparse
integration grids constructed via the Smolyak algorithm \cite{burkardt,
eldred2008, heiss2008}. The algorithm preserves the accuracy of the underlying
one-dimensional rules for complete polynomials while significantly reducing the
number of points. For instance, in the example given earlier, the number of
points computed by the algorithm is only $\nq = 1~581$, which implies a drastic
saving of the computation time.
