The reliability model here is based on the one presented in \cite{huang2009b,
xiang2010}. The time to failure of a processing element is a random variable $T$
that is assumed to have a Weibull distribution, which is denoted as follows:
\[
  T \sim \mathrm{Weibull}(\scale, \shape)
\]
where $\scale$ and $\shape$ are called the scale and shape parameters,
respectively. The distribution function of $T$ is
\begin{equation} \elab{weibull-distribution}
  F(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\left(\frac{t}{\scale}\right)^\shape\right);
\end{equation}
the complementary distribution function of $T$ is
\begin{equation} \elab{weibull-reliability}
  R(t) = 1 - F(t) = \exp\left(-\left(\frac{t}{\scale}\right)^\shape\right);
\end{equation}
and the expectation of $T$ is
\begin{equation} \elab{weibull-expectation}
  \mean = \expectation{T} = \scale \: \Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{\shape}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function. In this context of reliability analysis,
$F$ gives the probability of failure before a certain moment; $R$ gives the
probability of survival up to a certain moment, and it is called the reliability
function; and $\mean$ corresponds to the \ac{MTTF} of the processing element.

Let \period be the time horizon of interest. It is natural to expect that the
usage conditions and, hence, wear change over time. Then the distribution of $T$
should reflect this aspect, which is not yet prominent in
\eref{weibull-distribution}. In order to account for this, the time span is
split into \ns time intervals $\{ \dt_i: i = \range{1}{\ns} \}$ so that the
conditions that are relevant to the model stay unchanged within each interval.
Let $T_i \sim \mathrm{Weibull}(\scale_i, \shape_i)$ be the time to failure that
the processing element would have if interval $i$ was the only interval present
and denote by $\mean_i$ the corresponding \ac{MTTF} according to
\eref{weibull-expectation}. In the case of temperature-induced failures, we have
that $\shape_i = \shape$ for $i = \range{1}{\ns}$, that is, all the shape
parameters are equal. The reason is that, unlike the scale parameters, the shape
parameters are independent of the operating temperature \cite{chang2006}.

As shown in \cite{xiang2010}, in the above scenario, the reliability function of
the processing element can still be approximated by means of
\eref{weibull-reliability} by letting
\[
  \scale = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^\ns \dt_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^\ns \frac{\Delta t_i}{\scale_i}}.
\]
Applying \eref{weibull-expectation} at the level of individual intervals,
$\scale$ is rewritten as
\[
  \scale = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^\ns \dt_i}{\Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{\shape}\right) \sum_{i = 1}^\ns \frac{\Delta t_i}{\mean_i}}.
\]
Note that the reliability model in \eref{weibull-reliability} becomes fully
specified as soon as $\dt_i$ and $\mean_i$ are identified for $i =
\range{1}{\ns}$. This part of the model depends on the particular failure
mechanism considered. In the rest of this section, we tailor the model to the
thermal-cycling fatigue, which is of interest to us due to its prominent
dependence on temperature oscillations.

In the case of thermal cycling, the time intervals with constant relevant
conditions correspond to thermal cycles. In order to detect them in a given
temperature curve, the rainflow counting method is utilized \cite{xiang2010}. As
a result, a set of \ns thermal cycles is obtained. Each detected cycle is
characterized by a number of properties including its duration, which is the
desired $\dt_i$. Regarding the corresponding $\mean_i$, it can be expressed as
follows:
\[
  \mean_i = \nc_i \dt_i
\]
where $\nc_i$ stands for the mean number of such cycles to failure. This number
is estimated using a modified version of the Coffin--Manson equation with the
Arrhenius term as shown in the following equation \cite{xiang2010, jedec2016}:
\begin{equation} \elab{reliability-mean-cycles}
  \nc = a (\Delta \q - \Delta \q_0)^{-b} \exp\left(\frac{c}{k \q_\maximum}\right)
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$ (called the Coffin--Manson exponent), and $c$ (called the
activation energy) are empirically determined constants; $k$ is the Boltzmann
constant; $\Delta \q$ is the excursion of the cycle in question; $\Delta \q_0$
is the portion of the temperature excursion that resides in the elastic region,
which does not cause damage; and $\q_\maximum$ is the maximum temperature during
the cycle.

The reliability model of a single processing element is now fully specified. The
reliability function is the one in \eref{weibull-reliability} with
\begin{equation} \elab{reliability-scale}
  \scale = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^\ns \dt_i}{\Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{\shape}\right) \sum_{i = 1}^\ns \frac{1}{\nc_i}}
\end{equation}
where $\nc_i$ is as in \eref{reliability-mean-cycles}. Using
\eref{weibull-expectation}, the \ac{MTTF} of the processing element is
\begin{equation} \elab{reliability-mean-time}
  \mean = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^\ns \dt_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^\ns \frac{1}{\nc_i}}.
\end{equation}

In conclusion, it should be noted that the reliability model requires detailed
information about the thermal cycles that the processing element is exposed to,
which is the topic of the subsequent sections.
