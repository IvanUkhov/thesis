Consider a generic electronic system that consists of \np processors and is
equipped with a thermal package. In this thesis, a processor is any active
component of the system, that is, any component that consumes power. The thermal
package is the cooling equipment of the system including any passive components,
that is, any components that do not consume power. Processors can be identified
at different levels of granularity; for instance, a processor can correspond to
a \up{SoC}, \up{CPU}, \up{ALU}, cache, or communication bus.
