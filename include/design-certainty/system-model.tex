Consider a generic electronic system that consists of \np heterogeneous
processing elements and is equipped with a thermal package. A processing element
is any active component of the system, that is, any component that consumes
power. The thermal package is the cooling equipment of the system including any
passive components, that is, any components that do not consume power.
Processing elements can be identified at different levels of granularity. For
instance, a processing element can correspond to a system on a chip, central
processing unit, arithmetic logic unit, cache memory, or communication bus. In
the majority of the discussions in the thesis, processing elements are treated
as processing units or cores of a multiprocessor system.
