Consider a generic electronic system that consists of \np processors and is
equipped with a thermal package. A processor is any active component of the
system, that is, any component that consumes power. The thermal package is the
cooling equipment of the system including any passive components, that is, any
components that do not consume power. Processors can be identified at different
levels of granularity. For instance, a processor can correspond to a system on a
chip, central processing unit, arithmetic logic unit, cache memory, or
communication bus. In the majority of the discussions, processors are treated as
processing units or cores of a multiprocessor system.
