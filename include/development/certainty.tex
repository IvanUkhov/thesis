\chapter{Development with Certainty}

In this chapter, we elaborate on deterministic system-level analysis of computer
systems. The techniques that we discuss here do not take uncertainty into
account. However, these techniques provide a solid foundation for those that do
as we shall describe in the following chapter, \cref{development-uncertainty}.

\section{Power and Temperature Interdependence}
\slab{power-temperature-interdependence}

The power consumption of an electrical circuit consists of two main components:
dynamic and static. The dynamic power is due to the actual useful work done by
the circuit. The static power is due to various parasitic currents that cannot
be entirely eliminated. The major component of the static power is the leakage
power, which is especially prominent in modern \up{CMOS} transistors. The
leakage power and, therefore, the total power are strong functions of the
operating temperature, which cannot be neglected. In order to take this
phenomenon into account in the computation of the \up{DSSTP} described in
\sref{dynamic-steady-state-present}, two techniques can be applied as follows.

First of all, the power and temperature profiles can be calculated several times
in turns until they stop changing. With each new temperature profile we update
the power profile by computing the leakage power and adding it to the dynamic
power: $\mathbb{P}_i = \mathbb{P}_\text{dyn} +
\mathbb{P}_\text{leak}(\mathbb{T}_i)$. The process continues until the
temperature converges, i.e., the difference between two successive temperature
profiles is below a predefined bound. In our experiments we used $0.5^\circ C$
as the maximal acceptable difference and observed that the number of required
iterations to converge is 4--7.

A linear approximation of the leakage power has the following matrix form:
$\v{P}_\text{leak}(\v{T}) = \m{A} \: \v{T}(t) + \v{B}$ where $\m{A}$ is a $N_n
\times N_n$ diagonal matrix of the proportionality and $\v{B}$ is a vector with
$N_n$ elements of the intercept. Both characterize the leakage power for each of
the $N_n$ thermal nodes in the system. It can be seen that the approximation
keeps \eref{temperature-model-original} untouched: $\m{C} \:
\frac{d\v{T}(t)}{dt} + \bar{\m{G}} \: (\v{T}(t) - \v{T}_\ambient) = \bar{\v{P}}$
where $\bar{\m{G}} = \m{G} - \m{A}$ and $\bar{\v{P}} = \v{P}_\text{dyn} + \m{A}
\: \v{T}_\ambient + \v{B}$. Therefore, all solutions proposed in this paper are
perfectly valid with the linearized model. Moreover, in spite of its simplicity,
the model provides a good estimation, as shown in \cite{liu2007}.

In order to evaluate the linearization, we have constructed a number of
hypothetical platforms with 2--32 cores (other parameters are given in
\tref{parameters}) and compared temperature profiles obtained with the
linearization and the exponential model (\sref{power-model}), respectively. For
the later, we use the iterative approach described in
\sref{power-temperature-interdependence}. For the linearization, the power curve
fitting with the least squares regression \cite{press2007} has been employed,
targeted at the range between 40 and $80^\circ C$. From the experiments we have
observed that the NRMSE is bounded by 1--2\%, indicating a good accuracy of the
linear approximation.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have proposed an efficient and accurate technique to calculate
the SSDTP of an embedded multiprocessor system. Using the proposed approach, we
conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization based on the thermal
cycling failure mechanism and have shown that taking into consideration the
temperature variations within a multicore platform can significantly prolong its
lifetime without affecting its energy efficiency. The improvement, compared
using the state of the art, is significant.
