\chapter{Development with Certainty}

In this chapter, we elaborate on deterministic system-level analysis of computer
systems. The techniques that we discuss here do not take uncertainty into
account. However, these techniques provide a solid foundation for those that do
as we shall describe in the following chapter, \cref{development-uncertainty}.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have proposed an efficient and accurate technique to calculate
the SSDTP of an embedded multiprocessor system. Using the proposed approach, we
conducted a temperature-aware reliability optimization based on the thermal
cycling failure mechanism and have shown that taking into consideration the
temperature variations within a multicore platform can significantly prolong its
lifetime without affecting its energy efficiency. The improvement, compared
using the state of the art, is significant.
