In this chapter, we have elaborated on the possibility of mitigating workload
uncertainty at runtime and, more specifically, presented our experience of
working with state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks in the context of
fine-grained long-range prediction of resource usage in computer systems. Our
workflow---which starts by making the data readily available for learning and
finishes by making predictions with respect to individual tasks multiple time
steps into the future---has been described in detail and applied to a large data
set of real resource-usage profiles collected in a computer cluster.

The obtained results suggest that the fine-grained resource-usage profiles that
have been studied possess a certain structure, and that this structure can be
extracted by advanced machine-learning techniques and subsequently utilized for
making educated predictions. This detailed information could be of great use to
the resource manager of the computer system under consideration, allowing the
manager to more intelligently orchestrate the system.
