As emphasized throughout the thesis, electronic-system designs that ignore
uncertainty are both inefficient and unreliable. Acknowledging this exigent
concern, in this chapter, we have developed a flexible system-level framework
for the analysis of electronic systems subject to process variation. The
proposed framework is capable of modeling diverse system-level quantities
dependent on diverse process parameters obeying diverse probability
distributions. Our methodology delivers a lightweight representation of the
quantity under analysis and, thereby, allows the designer to computationally
efficiently calculate the probability distribution and other characteristics of
this quantity.

Leveraging our general methodology, we have presented a technique targeted at
quantifying transient power and temperature variations of electronic systems
under process variation. The technique has been applied in a context of
particular importance where the variability of the effective channel length has
been addressed. We have drawn a comparison with direct sampling, which has
confirmed the efficiency of our technique in terms of accuracy and speed.

We have also presented a process-variation-aware technique for dynamic
steady-state power and temperature analysis as well as proposed a technique for
reliability analysis that seamlessly takes into account the variability of
process parameters and, in particular, the impact of process variation on the
operating temperature. In this case, we have compared our performance with the
one of direct sampling by considering the influence of not only the effective
channel length but also the gate oxide thickness. The obtained results have
shown the efficiency of our solution with respect to both accuracy and speed.

The low computational demand featured by the proposed framework implies that our
uncertainty analysis can be straightforwardly performed inside
design-space-exploration loops, including those aimed at energy and reliability
optimization with temperature-related constraints under process variation. This
important virtue has been demonstrated by considering an energy-driven
probabilistic optimization procedure under temperature- and reliability-related
constraints. It has been shown that temperature has to be treated as a
stochastic quantity in order to make electronic systems reliable.

Finally, note that, even though our framework has been illustrated by
considering the effective channel length, gate oxide thickness, and a number of
specific quantities of interest, it can be readily applied to other problems
requiring process variation to be effectively and efficiently taken into
account.
