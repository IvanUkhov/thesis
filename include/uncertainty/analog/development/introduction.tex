Process variation is a phenomenon that is important to take into consideration
when developing computer systems, which is motivated in
\sref{process-variation}. In order to assist the designer, we present a
framework that allows the designer to propagate the uncertainty due to process
variation through the system under development and, thereby, investigate and
account for its impact on the system's behavior. In particular, it enables power
and temperature analysis as well as reliability analysis to be undertaken in
such a way that process variation is adequately considered. In the case of
reliability analysis, for example, our framework delivers a reliability
function---founded on the basis of well-established reliability models---with a
computationally efficient stochastic parameterization. The proposed approach is
exemplified considering a number of concrete problems. In particular, we analyze
systems with periodic workloads that suffer from the thermal-cycling fatigue and
construct and execute a design-space exploration procedure aimed to minimizing
the expected energy consumption of the system under a number of probabilistic
constraints.

We proceed as follows. A motivational example is given in
\sref{chaos-motivation}. The objective of our study is formulated in
\sref{chaos-problem}. \sref{chaos-prior} provides an overview of the prior work.
The proposed framework is delineated in \sref{chaos-solution} and
\sref{chaos-uncertainty-analysis}. The case of transient analysis is considered
in \sref{chaos-transient-analysis}, \sref{chaos-transient-application}, and
\sref{chaos-transient-results}. In \sref{chaos-dynamic-steady-state-analysis},
dynamic steady-state analysis is addressed. The approach to reliability analysis
is described in \sref{chaos-reliability-analysis}. In
\sref{chaos-reliability-optimization}, \sref{chaos-reliability-application}, and
\sref{chaos-reliability-results}, reliability optimization is undertaken.
\sref{chaos-conclusion} concludes the chapter.
