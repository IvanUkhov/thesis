In this chapter, we have presented a framework for characterizing process
variation across semiconductor wafers based on indirect measurements. The
technique has been exposed to extensive experiments, and the obtained results
have shown the computational efficiency and accuracy of our approach.

The presented framework is capable of quantifying primary parameters affected by
process variation, such as the effective channel length, which is in contrast to
the former techniques where only secondary parameters are considered, such as
the leakage current. Instead of taking direct measurements of the quantity of
interest, we employ Bayesian inference in order to draw justifiable conclusions
based on indirect observations, such as temperature measurements. The proposed
approach has low costs since no deployment of expensive test structures might be
needed, or only a small part of the test equipment that is already deployed on
the dies for other purposes might need to be engaged.

Finally, we would like to emphasize that, although the proposed framework has
been demonstrated by considering the effective channel length and temperature,
it can be readily utilized for analyzing any other quantity of interest based on
any other quantity of measurement provided that the latter depends on the
former, and that there is a model of this dependence available.
