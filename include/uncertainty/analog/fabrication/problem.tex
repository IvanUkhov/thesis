Consider a generic silicon wafer that accommodates \nd dies. We are interested
in studying a certain process parameter, which is denoted by \g and referred to
as the quantity of interest. Due to process variation, the value of \g deviates
from the nominal one, and it can be different at different locations on the
wafer. The parameter is assumed to be impractical to be measured directly.

The goal is to develop a framework for identifying the on-wafer distribution of
the quantity of interest \g with the following properties: \one~low measurement
costs, \two~robustness to measurement noise, \three~ability to accommodate prior
knowledge on \g, and \four~ability to assess the credibility of the collected
data and the corresponding predictions, and \five~high computation speed.
