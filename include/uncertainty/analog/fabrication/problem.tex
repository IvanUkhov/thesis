Consider a generic computer system that is fabricated on a silicon wafer which
accommodates \nd dies. The system depends on a process parameter denoted by \g,
which we are interested in studying and refer to as the quantity of interest.
Due to the presence of process variation, the value of \g deviates from the
nominal one, and this deviation can be different at different locations on the
wafer. The quantity is assumed to be impractical to be measured directly.

The goal is to develop a framework targeted at the identification of the
on-wafer distribution of \g with the following properties: \one~low measurement
costs, \two~high computation speed, \three~robustness to the measurement noise,
\four~ability to accommodate prior knowledge on \g, and \five~ability to assess
the trustworthiness of the collected data and corresponding predictions.
