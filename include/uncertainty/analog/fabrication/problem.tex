Consider a generic computer system that is fabricated on a silicon wafer which
accommodates \nd dies. The system depends on a process parameter that we are
interested in studying; the parameter is denoted by \g and referred to as the
quantity of interest. Due to process variation, the value of \g deviates from
the nominal one, and this deviation can be different at different locations on
the wafer. The parameter is assumed to be impractical to be measured directly.

The goal is to develop a framework for identifying the on-wafer distribution of
the quantity of interest \g with the following properties: \one~low measurement
costs, \two~robustness to measurement noise, \three~ability to accommodate prior
knowledge on \g, and \four~ability to assess the credibility of the collected
data and the corresponding predictions, and \five~high computation speed.
