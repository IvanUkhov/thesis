In this chapter, we have elaborated on the possibility of mitigating workload
uncertainty at runtime and, more specifically, presented our experience of
working with the state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks in the context of
fine-grained long-range prediction of the resource usage in a large computer
system. Our workflow---which starts from making the data readily available for
learning and finishes by making predictions with respect to individual tasks
multiple time steps into the future---has been described in detail and applied
to a large data set of real resource-usage profiles collected in a computer
cluster.

The experimental results suggest that the considered fine-grained profiles
possess a certain structure, and that this structure can be extracted by
advanced machine-learning techniques and subsequently utilized for making
educated predictions. This detailed information can be of use to such a crucial
component as the resource manager of the computer system under consideration,
allowing the manager to more intelligently orchestrate the system.
