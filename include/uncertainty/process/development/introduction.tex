As discussed in \sref{process-variation}, process variation has to be addressed
by the designer. In order to assist the designer, we present a framework that
allows one to propagate uncertainty stemming from process variation through the
system under development and thereby investigate and take account of its impact
on the system's behavior. In particular, it enables power and temperature
analysis as well as reliability analysis to be undertaken in such a way that
process variation is adequately considered. In the case of reliability analysis,
for example, our framework delivers a reliability function---founded on the
basis of well-established reliability models---with a computationally efficient
probabilistic parameterization. The proposed approach is demonstrated by
considering a number of problems. In particular, we analyze systems with
periodic workloads that suffer from thermal cycling and construct and execute a
design-space-exploration procedure aimed at minimizing the expected energy
consumption of the system under a number of probabilistic constraints.
