As discussed in \sref{process-variation}, process variation is an exigent
concern of electronic-system designs since it can lead to deterioration in
efficiency and to faults of various magnitudes. Therefore, process variation
should be adequately analyzed as the first step toward an efficient and robust
product.

An important problem in this regard is to characterize the on-wafer distribution
of a quantity deteriorated by process variation given a set of measurements. The
problem belongs to the class of inverse problems since the measured data can be
seen as an output of the system at hand, and the desired quantity can be seen as
an input. Such an inverse problem is addressed here.

Our goal is to estimate on-wafer distributions of arbitrary process parameters
with high accuracy and at low costs. The goal is accomplished by measuring
auxiliary quantities that are more convenient and less expensive to work with,
and then employing statistics in order to infer the desired parameters from the
measurements. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to the quantification of
process variation based on indirect and potentially incomplete and noisy
measurements. Moreover, we develop a solid framework around the proposed idea
and perform a thorough study of various aspects of our technique.
