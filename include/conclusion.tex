Modern electronic systems are complex, operate in complex environments, and
perform complex tasks. Even in the deterministic case, analysis and design of
such systems are highly challenging endeavors. However, their difficulty is
escalated even further by uncertainty that accompanies electronic systems.

The objective of this thesis has been to assist the designer of electronic
systems by providing tools that would allow for effective and efficient
quantification and mitigation of uncertainty that stems from the fabrication
process, workload, and aging. In this final chapter, we recapitulate the main
outcomes of the work that has been presented and outline directions for future
work.
