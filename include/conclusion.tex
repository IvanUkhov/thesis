Modern electronic systems are complex, and they operate in complex environments
and perform complex tasks. Analysis and design of electronic systems are already
highly challenging endeavors; however, the difficulty is escalated even further
by the inevitable uncertainty associated with these endeavors.

The objective of this thesis has been to assist the designer of electronic
systems by providing the tools that would allow the designer to effectively and
efficiently characterize uncertainty and take it into consideration. In this
final chapter, we recapitulate the main outcomes of our work that has been
presented in the thesis and outline potential directions for future work.
