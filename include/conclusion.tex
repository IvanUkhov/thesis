Modern electronic systems are complex, and they operate in complex environments
and perform complex tasks. Already in the deterministic case, analysis and
design of electronic systems are highly challenging, but their difficulty is
escalated even further by the uncertainty that accompanies such systems.

The objective of this thesis has been to assist the designer of electronic
systems by providing tools that would allow the designer to effectively and
efficiently characterize uncertainty and take it into consideration. In this
final chapter, we recapitulate the main outcomes of the work that has been
presented in the thesis and outline potential directions for future work.
