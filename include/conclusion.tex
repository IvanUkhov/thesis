Modern electronic systems are complex, and they operate in complex environments
and perform complex tasks. Analysis and design of such systems are highly
challenging endeavors \perse; however, their difficulty is escalated much
further by the inevitable uncertainty associated with electronic systems.

The objective of this thesis has been to assist the designer of electronic
systems by providing the tools that would allow the designer to effectively and
efficiently characterize uncertainty and subsequently take it into account. In
this final chapter, we recapitulate the main outcomes of the work that has been
presented in the thesis and outline potential directions for future work.
