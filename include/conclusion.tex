Modern electronic systems are complex, operate in complex environments, and
perform complex tasks. Even in the deterministic case, analysis and design of
such systems are highly challenging endeavors. However, their difficulty is
escalated even further by uncertainty that accompanies electronic systems.

The objective of this thesis has been to assist the designer of electronic
systems by providing tools that would allow for effective and efficient
quantification and mitigation of uncertainty due to the fabrication process,
workload, and aging. In this final chapter, we recapitulate the main outcomes of
the work that has been presented and outline potential directions for future
work.
