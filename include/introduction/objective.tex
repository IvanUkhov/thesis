Our goal is to assist the designer of computer systems by providing effective
and efficient system-level tools for analysis and design under uncertainty. To
this end, we are to develop techniques for quantifying and mitigating
uncertainty stemming from such sources as the fabrication process, aging, and
workload. We particularly strive for such solutions that are applicable to
diverse practical problems and that are flexible and straightforward to utilize.
