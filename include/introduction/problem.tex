Our goal is to assist the designer of electronic systems by providing effective
and efficient system-level tools for analysis and design under uncertainty. To
this end, we are to develop techniques for quantifying and mitigating the
variability that originates from the fabrication process, workload, and aging.

In particular, we intend to develop solutions that are applicable to diverse
practical problems and that are flexible and straightforward to use. In
addition, we are interested in calculating probability distributions---which are
exhaustive characterizations---rather than, for instance, corner cases, since
designing for the worst case often leads to a conservative and overdesigned
system.
