Our goal is to assist the designer of computer systems by providing effective
and efficient system-level tools for analysis and design under uncertainty. To
this end, we are to develop techniques for quantifying and mitigating
uncertainty such as the one stemming from fabrication, aging, and operation of
computer systems. We particularly strive for such solutions that are applicable
to diverse practical problems and that are flexible and straightforward to use.
