Our goal is to assist the designer of computer systems by providing effective
and efficient system-level tools for analysis and design under uncertainty. To
this end, we are to develop techniques for quantifying and mitigating
uncertainty such as the one stemming from fabrication, aging, and workload.

We particularly aim at such solutions that are applicable to diverse practical
problems and that are flexible and straightforward to use. In addition, we are
interested in obtaining probability distributions---which are exhaustive
characterizations---rather than, for instance, in estimating corner cases since
designing for the worst case often leads to a poor solution as the system under
consideration might easily end up conservative, overdesigned \cite{quinton2012}.
