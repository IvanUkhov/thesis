Our work makes the following major contributions:

\begin{itemize}

\item
We propose an accurate and fast approach to deterministic dynamic steady-state
temperature analysis as well as improve deterministic transient temperature
analysis. Leveraging our efficient approach, we develop a
reliability-optimization scheme targeted at reducing the thermal-cycling fatigue
and, thereby, at alleviating condition uncertainty.

\item
We develop a versatile statistical framework for analyzing the variability of
process parameters induced by the fabrication process across silicon wafers. The
key feature of the proposed approach is that it operates on indirect
measurements, which streamlines its usage and allows for a reduction of the
expenses associated with the production process.

\item
We develop a versatile probabilistic framework for analyzing system-level
quantities affected by process variation. Using our technique, we enhance
reliability analysis and optimization of electronic systems by taking account of
process uncertainty in reliability models, which also leads to a more
comprehensive treatment of condition uncertainty.

\item
We develop a versatile probabilistic framework for analyzing system-level
quantities affected by workload variation, which tends to engender a less
regular variability than the one stemming from the fabrication process and,
therefore, necessitates a different solution technique.

\item
We perform an early yet informative investigation of the utility of the latest
advancements in the field of machine learning for mitigating workload
uncertainty at runtime in the context of resource management. Specifically, we
apply the aforementioned advancements to fine-grained long-range forecasting of
resource usage in large computer systems.
