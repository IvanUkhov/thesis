Analysis and design of computer systems are difficult \emph{per se}; however,
the difficulty is magnified even further by the presence of uncertainty
introduced in the previous subsection. Regardless of its origin, uncertainty
renders the behavior of the computer system at hand random, nondeterministic to
the designer. The presence of uncertainty can lead to degradation of the quality
of service in the best case and to severe faults or burnt silicon in the
worst-case scenario. Consequently, it is crucial to analyze and quantify
uncertainty in computer systems and to mitigate its damaging consequences by
designing these systems in such a way that they are well aware of uncertainty
and well equipped with mechanisms to effectively and efficiently take it into
consideration.
