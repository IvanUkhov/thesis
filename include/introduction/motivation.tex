In the context of current and future technologies, it is both inefficient and
unreliable to rely exclusively on uncertainty-unaware techniques when developing
electronic systems. Regardless of its origin, uncertainty causes certain aspects
of the system under consideration to be nondeterministic to the designer.
Therefore, if the presence of uncertainty is disregarded, it can lead to
degradation of the quality of service in the best case and to severe faults or
burnt silicon in the worst case. Under these circumstances, it is crucial to
analyze and quantify uncertainty in electronic systems and to mitigate its
deleterious implications by designing electronic systems in such a way that they
are able to take uncertainty into account in an effective and efficient manner.

Even in the deterministic scenario, analysis and design of electronic systems
are difficult undertakings. However, uncertainty exacerbates the situation even
further, requiring adequate techniques for analysis and design that allow for
uncertainty. Versatile uncertainty-aware tools are meager at best, and in the
case of certain problems, they are non-existent. However, such techniques are a
must; they are an indispensable asset of design workflows that strive to provide
guarantees on efficiency and robustness for their products.
