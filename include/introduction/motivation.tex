Computer systems that are developed relying exclusively on techniques which
ignore uncertainty is---in the context of current and future technologies---both
inefficient and unreliable. Regardless of its origin, uncertainty renders the
behavior of the system at hand nondeterministic to the designer of this system
and, if disregarded, leads to degradation of the quality of service in the best
case and to severe faults or burnt silicon in the worst-case scenario.
Consequently, it is crucial to analyze and quantify uncertainty in computer
systems and to mitigate its deteriorating consequences by designing these
systems in such a way that they are well aware of uncertainty and well equipped
with mechanisms to effectively and efficiently take it into consideration.

Analysis and design of computer systems are difficult undertakings already in
the Utopian deterministic case; however, the presence of uncertainty exacerbates
the situation even further. This, in turn, escalates the difficulty of
developing adequate techniques for analysis and design. Versatile
uncertainty-aware tools are meager and, in the case of certain problems,
non-existent, but such techniques are a must; they are an indispensable asset of
design workflows that are concerned with efficiency and robustness of their
products.
