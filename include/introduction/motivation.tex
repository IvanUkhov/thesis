Electronic systems that are developed relying exclusively on techniques which
ignore uncertainty is, in the context of current and future technologies, both
inefficient and unreliable. Regardless of its origin, uncertainty renders the
behavior of the system under consideration nondeterministic to the designer of
this system and, if disregarded, leads to degradation of the quality of service
in the best case and to severe faults or burnt silicon in the worst-case
scenario. Consequently, it is crucial to analyze and quantify uncertainty in
electronic systems and to mitigate its deteriorating consequences by designing
these systems in such a way that they are well aware of uncertainty and well
equipped with mechanisms to effectively and efficiently take it into
consideration.

Already in the Utopian deterministic scenario, analysis and design of electronic
systems are difficult undertakings, but the presence of uncertainty exacerbates
the situation even further and necessitates adequate techniques for analysis and
design under uncertainty. Versatile uncertainty-aware tools are meager and, in
the case of certain problems, non-existent. However, such techniques are a must;
they are an indispensable asset of design workflows that strive to provide
guarantees on efficiency and robustness of their products.
