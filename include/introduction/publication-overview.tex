The content of the thesis is chiefly based on the following two conference
papers and three journal articles:

In addition, the following two technical reports are used in the thesis:

The above publications correspond to the content of the thesis as follows. The
work on uncertainty-unaware analysis and design presented in \cite{ukhov2012} is
covered in \cref{certainty-development}. The statistical approach to analyzing
process variation developed in \cite{ukhov2014a} is presented in
\cref{uncertainty-analog-fabrication}. The probabilistic techniques for analysis
and design under process variation proposed in \cite{ukhov2014b} and
\cite{ukhov2015} are amalgamated in \cref{uncertainty-analog-development}. The
probabilistic approach to analysis under workload variation introduced in
\cite{ukhov2017a} is elaborated on in \cref{uncertainty-digital-development}.
The work on workload prediction for resource management given in
\cite{ukhov2017b} is described in \cref{uncertainty-digital-management}, which
is also closely related to the data synthesis discussed in \cite{ukhov2017c}.
