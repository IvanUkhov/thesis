papers and three journal articles:

In addition, the following two technical reports are used in the thesis:

The publications listed above correspond to the content of the thesis as
follows. The work on uncertainty-unaware analysis and design presented in
\cite{ukhov2012} is covered in \cref{certainty-development}. The approach to
characterization of process variation developed in \cite{ukhov2014a} is
presented in \cref{uncertainty-process-fabrication}. The techniques for analysis
and design under process variation proposed in \cite{ukhov2014b} and
\cite{ukhov2015} are amalgamated in \cref{uncertainty-process-development}. The
approach to analysis under workload variation introduced in \cite{ukhov2017a} is
elaborated on in \cref{uncertainty-workload-development}. The work on workload
prediction for resource management given in \cite{ukhov2017b} is described in
\cref{uncertainty-workload-operation}, which is also closely related to the data
synthesis discussed in \cite{ukhov2017c}.
