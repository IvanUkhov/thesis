Electronic systems are omnipresent and omniscient. They continue to invade and
conquer new application areas, penetrating deep into everyday life and becoming
unsettlingly indispensable for the tasks entrusted to them. Thus, the impact of
uncertainty associated with electronic systems inevitably becomes more prominent
and entails more severe consequences, requiring appropriate treatment. It is
then readily understandable that analysis and design of electronic systems are
intensely difficult and vastly far-reaching endeavors.

System-level analysis and design of electronic systems with an emphasis on
uncertainty is the topic of this thesis. In this section, we give an
introduction to our work and, in particular, summarize our motivations,
objectives, and contributions. However, in order to give a clear presentation,
we first elaborate on what is meant by the word \emph{uncertainty} in the
context of the thesis.
