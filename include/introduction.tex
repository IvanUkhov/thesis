Computer systems are omnipresent and omniscient. They penetrate deep into
everyday life and are unsettlingly indispensable and increasingly intelligent at
tasks entrusted to them. It is readily understandable that analysis and design
of computer systems are acutely difficult and vastly far-reaching endeavors.

System-level analysis and design of computer systems is the topic of this
thesis. In this section, we summarize our motivation, objective, and
contribution in this regard as well as give an overview of the thesis and our
publications relevant to the thesis. In order to give a clear presentation, we
first elaborate on one acute aspect of computer systems: the presence of
uncertainty.
