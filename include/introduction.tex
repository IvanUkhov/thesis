Electronic systems are omnipresent and omniscient. They naturally become more
sophisticated and refined and continue to find and conquer new application
areas, penetrating deep into everyday life and becoming unsettlingly
indispensable at tasks entrusted to them. Under these circumstances, the impact
of uncertainty associated with electronic systems inevitably becomes more
prominent and entails more severe consequences, necessitating an adequate
treatment. Thus, it is readily understandable that analysis and design of
electronic systems are acutely difficult and vastly far-reaching endeavors.

System-level analysis and design of electronic systems with an emphasis on
uncertainty is the topic of this thesis. In this section, we give an
introduction to our work and, in particular, summarize our motivation,
objective, and contribution. However, in order to give a clear presentation, we
first explicate what is meant by the word \emph{uncertainty} in the context of
this thesis.
