\chapter{Introduction}
\dropcap{U}{ncertainty} is important. A prominent source of uncertainty is
process variation: the process parameters of fabricated nanoscale devices
deviate from their nominal values since the contemporary fabrication process
cannot be controlled precisely down to the level of individual atoms. Another
source is performance variation: the performance of electronic systems degrades
over time due to natural or accelerated wear. Yet another and arguably the most
consequential source of uncertainty is workload variation: the actual runtime
workload that the system at hand will be exposed to in a production environment
is rarely, if ever, known in advance.
