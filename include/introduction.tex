Computer systems are omnipresent and omniscient. They penetrate deep into
everyday life and are unsettlingly indispensable and increasingly intelligent at
tasks entrusted to them. It is readily understandable that analysis and design
of computer systems are acutely difficult and vastly far-reaching endeavors.

Analysis and design of computer systems subject to uncertainty is the topic of
this thesis, and, in this section, we give an introduction to our work.
Specifically, we elaborate on our motivation, formulate our objective, and give
an overview of the thesis and our relevant publications. However, in order to
give a clear presentation, we first discuss uncertainty in computer systems.
