Computer systems are omnipresent and omniscient. They penetrate deep into
everyday life and are unsettlingly indispensable and increasingly intelligent at
the tasks entrusted to them. It is then understandable that the design of
computer systems is an acutely difficult and vastly far-reaching process.

One major concern of the designer of a computer system is the presence of
uncertainty, which, in many cases, is inherent and inevitable. A prominent
source of uncertainty is process variation: the process parameters of fabricated
nanoscale devices deviate from their nominal values since the contemporary
fabrication process cannot be controlled precisely down to the level of
individual atoms. Another source is performance variation: the performance of
electronic systems degrades over time due to natural or accelerated wear. Yet
another and arguably the most consequential source of uncertainty is workload
variation: the actual runtime workload that the system at hand will be exposed
to in a production environment is rarely, if ever, known in advance.

The aforementioned uncertainty in computer systems leads to degradation of the
quality and efficiency of service in the best case and to severe faults or burnt
silicon in the worst-case scenario. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge and
analyze uncertainty and to mitigate its deteriorating consequences by designing
computer systems in such a way that they are well aware of uncertainty and well
equipped with mechanisms to effectively and efficiently tackle it.

\section{Overview}

We begin by considering techniques for deterministic system-level analysis of
computer systems. These techniques do not take uncertainty into account;
however, they serve as a solid foundation for those that do. Our attention
revolves primarily around power and temperature as they are of central
importance for attaining robustness and energy efficiency. We develop a novel
and fast approach to dynamic steady-state temperature analysis of multiprocessor
systems and apply it in the context of reliability optimization.

We then proceed to developing techniques that address uncertainty. The first
technique of this kind is to infer the variability of process parameters that is
induced by process variation, across silicon wafers based on indirect
measurements such as readings from thermal sensors. The second technique is
applicable to studying diverse quantities with respect to the variability
originated from process variation. In particular, it allows for progressively
analyzing transient power and temperature profiles of multiprocessor systems. In
addition, dynamic steady-state temperature profiles can be quantified, and it is
illustrated by addressing a problem of design-space exploration with
probabilistic constraints related to reliability. The third technique that we
develop is to efficiently tackle less regular sources of uncertainty than
process variation such as workload variation. This technique is exemplified by
quantifying the effect that workload units with uncertain processing times have
on the timing-, power-, and temperature-related characteristics of
multiprocessor systems.

We finish by focusing on runtime management of computer systems under
uncertainty. In this context, we investigate the utility of advanced prediction
techniques for the purpose of fine-grained long-range forecasting of the
resource usage in cluster clusters. We also develop a computationally efficient
infrastructure for data synthesis in order to facilitate further research in
this direction by making it tractable to experiment with the highly promising
but data-demanding state-of-the-art techniques for modeling and prediction.
