In order to give a better intuition about our solutions, we shall accompany the
development of our framework with the development of a concrete
example/application, which will eventually be utilized for the quantitative
evaluation of the framework given in \sref{experimental-results}. To this end,
we have decided to focus on two process parameters, which are arguably the most
crucial ones, namely, the effective channel length $L$ and the gate-oxide
thickness $T$. In this example,
\[
  \vu = (L, T): \Omega \to \real^2,
\]
which is to be discussed in detail shortly. Regarding reliability, we shall
address the thermal-cycling fatigue as it is naturally connected with dynamic
steady-state temperature analysis that we develop.
