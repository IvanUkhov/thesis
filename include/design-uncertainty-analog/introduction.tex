As emphasized in \sref{inference-introduction}, process variation is a major
concern of the designer of electronic systems. A design that is exclusively
based on deterministic techniques for power and temperature analysis is, in the
context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient
since the presence of the deteriorating uncertainty due to process variation is
disregarded. In order to assist the designer, in this chapter, we develop a
framework that allows the designer to propagate this uncertainty through the
system under development and, thereby, investigate and account for its impact on
the system's behavior.

We proceed as follows. A motivational example is considered in
\sref{chaos-example}. The objective of our study is formulated in
\sref{chaos-problem}. \sref{chaos-prior} provides an overview of the prior work.
The proposed framework is presented in \sref{chaos-solution}. An exemplary
application of our approach is discussed in \sref{chaos-application}, and the
corresponding experimental results are given and compared with \ac{MC}
simulations in \sref{chaos-results}. \sref{chaos-conclusion} concludes the
chapter.
