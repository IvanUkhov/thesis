Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \probability)$ be a probability space as defined in
\sref{probability-theory} and assume the same system model as the one described
in \sref{system-model}. The system depends on \nu process parameters that are
uncertain at the design stage. These parameters are denoted by a random vector
$\vu: \Omega \to \real^\nu$. Once the fabrication process yields a particular
outcome, \vu takes potentially different values across each fabricated chip and
stays unchanged thereafter. This variability leads to deviations of power from
the nominal values and, therefore, to deviations of temperature from the one
corresponding to the nominal power consumption.

The goal is to develop a system-level framework for transient temperature and,
hence, power analysis of electronic systems where the power consumption and heat
dissipation are stochastic due to their dependency on the uncertain parameters
\vu. The user is required to specify \one~the probability distribution of \vu
and \two~the dependency of the power consumption on \vu, which can be given as a
``black box.'' The framework is to provide the user with the tools for analyzing
the system under a given workload, without imposing constraints on the nature of
this workload, and obtaining the corresponding stochastic power \mp and
temperature \mq profiles with a desired level of accuracy and at low costs.
