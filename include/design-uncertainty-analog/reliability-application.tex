In order to give a better intuition about the approach to reliability analysis
and optimization presented in \sref{chaos-reliability-analysis} and
\sref{chaos-reliability-optimization}, we consider a concrete application,
meaning that we specify the uncertain parameters and carry out the corresponding
computations. This application is also utilized for the quantitative evaluation
of our technique given in the next section, \sref{chaos-reliability-results}.

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Assume that the structure of the reliability model is the one shown in
\eref{reliability-model} where each individual reliability function $R_i$ is the
one given in \eref{weibull-reliability} with its own $\eta_i$ and $\beta_i$ for
$i = \range{1}{\np}$. During each iteration, the temperature of processing
element $i$ exhibits \nk{i} cycles. Each cycle generally has different
characteristics and, therefore, causes different damage. This aspect is taken
into account by adjusting $\eta_i$ as shown in \eref{thermal-cycling-scale}. The
shape parameter $\beta_i$ is known to be indifferent to temperature. For
simplicity, let us also assume that $\beta_i$ does not depend on process
parameters, and that $\beta_i = \beta$ for $i = \range{1}{\np}$.

Under the above assumptions, \rref{weibull-homogeneity} applies, and the
lifetime $\life: \Omega \to \real$ of the system has a Weibull distribution as
follows:
\[
  \life | (\eta, \beta) \sim \mathrm{Weibull}(\eta, \beta)
\]
where $\eta$ is as in \rref{weibull-homogeneity} combined with
\eref{thermal-cycling-scale}. Even though the model has two parameters, $\eta$
and $\beta$, only $\eta$ is uncertain. Therefore, we treat the model as having
only one parameter, $\eta$, and $\beta$ is assumed to be implicitly given.

In the case of reliability analysis without any accompanying optimization, one
can proceed to constructing a \ac{PC} expansion for $\eta$. Having obtained a
lightweight surrogate for $\eta$, the system's reliability can be studied from
various perspectives. In the current scenario, however, the quantity of interest
\g is the one given in \eref{chaos-optimization-quantity} since it allows for
evaluating the objective function and constraints defined in
\eref{chaos-optimization-objective} and \eref{chaos-optimization-constraints},
respectively. In \eref{chaos-optimization-quantity}, the component denoted by
\life stands for the parameterization of the reliability model, and,
consequently, it is equal to $\eta$ in the example developed in this section.

Let us not turn our attention to the uncertain parameters \vu. We focus on two
crucial process parameters, namely, on the effective channel length and
gate oxide thickness. Consequently, each processing element is ascribed two
random variables corresponding to the two process parameters, which means that
$\nu = 2 \np$ in this example; see also \sref{chaos-problem}.

\begin{remark}
The variability of a process parameter at a spatial location can be split into
several parts such as inter-lot, inter-wafer, inter-die, and intra-die; see, for
instance, \cite{juan2012}. However, from the mathematical point of view, it is
sufficient to consider just one random variable per location with an adequate
distribution and adequate correlations with the other locations of interest.
\end{remark}

Based on \sref{chaos-problem-formulation}, the parameters \vu are assumed to be
given as a set of marginal distributions and a correlation matrix denoted by $\{
F_i \}_{i = 1}^\nu$ and $\correlation{\vu}$, respectively. Note that the number
of distinct marginals is only two since \np components of \vu correspond to the
same process parameter.

Both considered process parameters, the effective channel length and gate oxide
thickness, correspond to Euclidean distances; they take values on bounded
intervals of the positive half of the real line. With this in mind, similar to
\sref{chaos-transient-application}, we model the two process parameters using
the four-parametric family of beta distributions shown in
\eref{beta-distribution}. Without loss of generality, the parameters are assumed
to be independent of each other, and the correlations among those elements of
\vu that correspond to the same process parameter are assumed to be given by the
correlation function shown in \eref{inference-correlation}.

The two process parameters manifest itself in the calculations associated with
the power model in \eref{chaos-power-model-bulk} through the static power. The
modeling here is based on \up{SPICE} simulations of a series of \up{CMOS}
invertors taken from the 45-nm open cell library by NanGate \cite{nangate} and
configured according to the 45-nm \up{PTM} \up{HP} model \cite{ptm}. The
simulations are performed on a fine-grained and sufficiently broad
three-dimensional grid comprising the effective channel length, gate oxide
thickness, and temperature; the results are tabulated. An interpolation
algorithm is then utilized whenever the static power has to be evaluated for a
particular point within the range of the grid. The output of this model is
scaled up to account for about 40\% of the total power dissipation
\cite{liu2007}. Regarding temperature modeling, the thermal \up{RC} circuit used
for dynamic steady-state analysis is constructed via HotSpot \cite{skadron2003}
as described in \sref{temperature-model}.

At this point, the two outputs of Stage~1 are now specified.

\subsection{Probability Transformation}

At Stage~2 in \fref{chaos-overview}, the uncertain parameters \vu are
transformed into independent random variables \vz via a suitable transformation
$\transform$. Specifically, we use the one in \eref{probability-transformation},
which also includes model order reduction. Unlike
\sref{chaos-transient-application}, in this section, we let \vz obey the
standard Gaussian distribution and, therefore, tailor $\transform$ accordingly;
see \sref{probability-transformation}.

\subsection{Surrogate Construction}

Since the expansion variables \vz are Gaussian, the polynomial basis considered
at Stage~3 is to be composed of Hermite polynomials, which is the exact scenario
described in \sref{polynomial-chaos}. The variables also tell us how to approach
numerical integration needed for the evaluation of the coefficients of \ac{PC}
expansions: since we are interested in integrals with respect to the standard
Gaussian measure, Gauss--Hermite quadrature rules \cite{maitre2010} are worth
considering. These quadratures are especially efficient since they belong to the
family of Gaussian quadratures and, thus, inherit their properties; see
\sref{numerical-integration}.

Lastly, let us illustrate of the Hermite basis. For a random vector $\vz: \Omega
\to \real$ with one standard Gaussian variable ($\nz = 1$), a second-level
\ac{PC} expansion ($\lc = 2$) of a quantity of interest $\vg: \Omega \to
\real^3$ with three outputs is
\[
  \chaos{1}{2}{\vg}
  = \hat{\vg}_{(0)} \psi_{(0)}
  + \hat{\vg}_{(1)} \psi_{(1)}
  + \hat{\vg}_{(2)} \psi_{(2)}
\]
where $\{ \hat{\vg}_{\vi} \} \subset \real^3$,
\begin{align*}
  & \psi_{(0)}(\vz) = 1, \\
  & \psi_{(1)}(\vz) = \z_1, \text{ and} \\
  & \psi_{(2)}(\vz) = \z_1^2 - 1.
\end{align*}
The expansion is post-processed at Stage~4 as described in
\sref{chaos-reliability-optimization}.
