In this chapter, we have presented a framework targeted at the quantification of
transient power and temperature variations of electronic systems under process
variation. The framework is capable of modeling diverse probability laws of the
underlying uncertain parameters and arbitrary dependencies of the system on such
parameters. For a given system under a given workload, our technique delivers
analytical representations of the corresponding stochastic power and temperature
profiles. These representations allow for a computationally efficient estimation
of the probability distributions and accompanying quantities of the power and
temperature characteristics of the system.

Our general technique has been applied in a context of particular importance
where the variability of the effective channel length has been addressed. Note,
however, that the framework can be readily utilized to analyze any other
quantities affected by process variation and to study their combinations. Using
this application, we have drawn a comparison with \ac{MC} sampling, which has
confirmed the efficiency of our approach in terms of both accuracy and speed.
The reduced execution times, by up to five orders of magnitude, implied by our
framework allow for the analysis to be efficiently performed inside design space
exploration loops aimed at, for instance, energy and reliability optimization
with temperature-related constraints under process variation.
